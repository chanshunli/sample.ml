  - > Machine learning (ML) is the study of
    powerful techniques that can learn behavior from experience. As ML algorithm accumulates more experience,
    typically in the form of observational data or interactions with an environment, their performance improves.

  - > Deep models are deep in precisely
    the sense that they learn many layers of computation. It turns out that these many-layered (or hierarchical)
    models are capable of addressing low-level perceptual data in a way that previous tools could not. In bygone
    days, the crucial part of applying ML to these problems consisted of coming up with manually engineered
    ways of transforming the data into some form amenable to shallow models. One key advantage of deep
    learning is that it replaces not only the shallow models at the end of traditional learning pipelines, but also
    the labor-intensive feature engineering. Secondly, by replacing much of the domain-specific preprocessing,
    deep learning has eliminated many of the boundaries that previously separated computer vision, speech
    recognition, natural language processing, medical informatics, and other application areas, offering a unified
    set of tools for tackling diverse problems.
